     * I have created a simple Page Object Model design pattern to answer these questions.
     *
     * The answer for a) and b) is in FoodItemPage class (methods).
     *
     * The script that uses the method is in "test" package.
     *
     * ScriptBase is to initialize the driver and do some other things.
     *
     * I like to design the framework similar to this way for reusability.
     *
     * Thank you!
